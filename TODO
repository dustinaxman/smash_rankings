Create code for one flask api that runs the following, based on values passed during the call, if a value is not included it should be None.  Make sure the api is cors enabled like this:
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)


from src.tournament_data_utils.utils import query_tournaments

make a dockerfile for running this api flask



# Make api that takes set of tournament slugs and returns players and scores
# make it also take tier and date filters and return list of all tournaments as keys in dict with each having True or False value



# Make a good looking react website that makes a request to get a list of tournament names and information (Tier (P, S, or A), date, and unique_id)
# In one tab, show all of these tournaments and their information (just tournament name, date, and tier) in a nice table where all rows are initially sage green
# At the top, give a field where the user can select a start and end date.  If not selected, the start date should default to Nov 1 2018 and the end date should default to today.
# They should also be given a field to select one or more Tiers. Finally they will be given a button "Compute rankings" next to a field selector "Type of ranking" with 3 values "Elo", "Bradley-Terry", and "TrueSkill". 
# As they change their selections in all of the fields except "Type of ranking", different rows in the table of tournaments should turn from green to pale red dynamically (make it pretty).  
# Tournaments whose date is in the date range and whose tier is in the set of tiers that the user has selected will be green, the rest will be red.  
# When the user presses the "Compute rankings" button, take the unique_ids of all of the tournaments and make a request to this api:


# the response will look like this:
# [{"player": "Mkleo", "score": 2000, "score_variance": 50}, {"player": "Tweek", "score": 1800, "score_variance": 150}, {"player": "Shuton", "score": 1600, "score_variance": 50}]


# In a new tab, display this sorted (by score, with largest at the top) list of rankings in a pretty table. Show each player, their score, and their score variance for the top 100 players.
# At the top of this tab, show the parameters for this ranking (the date range and the selected tiers).

# Output the file name and exact contents of each file in the react app.
